Game like Fruit Ninja, made on the 5th week of the Bootcamp at Academia de CÃ³digo in a group of 5 people. 
We've worked with simple graphics provided by the academy and had the challenge to work with their mouse which we had to change it to make it work on the project.
It was a big challenge but worth it to grow more as a team mate and with technical knowlegde.
