### Cadet Wars AC

Fruit Ninja inspired game, made at Academia de CÃ³digo bootcamp with a team
We've worked with simple graphics library provided by Academia which was a challenge to work with mainly because the mouse was malfunctioning
We could solve part of the issue by changing the library
Still needs improvement, as everything in life or coding, but in 5 weeks of learning to code we all together were able to make this game to be fun

Hope you enjoy, both our code
